[CVPR 2025](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/Dates).

This page is for CVPR 2025 workshops on Computer Vision for Drug Discovery: Where Are We and What is Beyond?

## Short info about the workshops

This workshop theme extends far beyond the traditional scope of CVPR, bridging the gap between computer vision, artificial intelligence, and the life sciences, particularly in the critical field of drug discovery. By integrating advanced imaging modalities like Spatial Transcriptomics, Cell Painting, and Optical Pooled Screening with cutting-edge computer vision techniques, the workshop fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in biomedical science, AI, and computer vision.

The broader impact of this effort lies in its potential to revolutionize drug discovery processes, enabling faster, more precise identification of therapeutic targets and accelerating the development of effective treatments for diseases. This is especially relevant in the context of modern challenges such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and pandemics, where AI-driven analysis of high-dimensional biological data can dramatically enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses.

For the CVPR audience, this represents a shift from traditional image processing and vision tasks (e.g., object detection, facial recognition) towards applications that directly impact public health and global well-being. The workshop will allow computer vision experts to apply their skills in high-stakes, socially impactful domains like healthcare and pharmaceutical research. It will also challenge researchers to adapt their techniques to handle the unique complexities of biological imaging, such as multi-modal data fusion, explainability in biomedical contexts, and interpreting noisy or sparse biological datasets.

In summary, the workshop aligns with CVPR's growing emphasis on AI for social good while offering a profound opportunity for computer vision researchers to contribute to transformative advances in medical science, which have the potential to impact millions of lives worldwide.

## List of invited speakers:

TBD

## Call for papers:
Two tracks are available: featuring papers for workshop proceedings and posters from recent publications in top conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI, as well as prominent journals such as Nature, Science, and Nature Methods.

The papers must follow the CVPR paper template. 

Paper Submission Deadline: March 1 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Notification of Acceptance: April 1 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Camera-Ready Deadline: April 7 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Final workshop program: May 9 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Workshop Date: June 12

## Challenge: 

### Dataset: 

Competition will use the 2020_11_04_CPJUMP1 dataset available publicly, see description https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/2024_Chandrasekaran_NatureMethods. Dataset contains images generated using chemical and genetic perturbation and 2 cell lines: U2OS and A549 in multiple replicates. Images and corresponding CellProfiler features are available.

### Task: 

Develop a method for transfer of information between cell lines using either CellProfiler features or raw images. Provide an image representation that is cell type-invariant.

### Evaluation: 

Generated representation will be evaluated in terms of compound matching task on the evaluation set using a MLP classifier and ChEMBL labels in 5 fold cross-validation. Train/test split will be undisclosed. Participants will also be asked to send a paper describing the methodology (up to 4 pages without citations).

###Timeline:

Start (call for participation): January 20 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Registration deadline: February 15 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Submission deadline: March 15 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Decisions to participants: May 1 '25 07:59 AM UT
