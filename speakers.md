This makes reusing models <br> from one experiment to another difficult, because the channels do not always match across experiments. <br> Here, we describe our efforts to create <br> foundation models that can be reused across <br> different types of imaging experiments, which are channel adaptive, donâ€™t require <br> training from scratch, and can match <br> or surpass the performance of specialized models.|
