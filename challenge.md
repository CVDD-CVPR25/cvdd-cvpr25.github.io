## Challenge: 

### Dataset: 

Competition will use the 2020_11_04_CPJUMP1 dataset available publicly, see description https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/2024_Chandrasekaran_NatureMethods. Dataset contains images generated using chemical and genetic perturbation and 2 cell lines: U2OS and A549 in multiple replicates. Images and corresponding CellProfiler features are available.

### Task: 

Develop a method for transfer of information between cell lines using either CellProfiler features or raw images. Provide an image representation that is cell type-invariant.

### Evaluation: 

Generated representation will be evaluated in terms of compound matching task on the evaluation set using a MLP classifier and ChEMBL labels in 5 fold cross-validation. Train/test split will be undisclosed. Participants will also be asked to send a paper describing the methodology (up to 4 pages without citations).

### Timeline:

Start (call for participation): January 20 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Registration deadline: February 15 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Submission deadline: March 15 '25 07:59 AM UTC

Decisions to participants: May 1 '25 07:59 AM UT
